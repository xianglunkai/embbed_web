DESCRIPTION
       The  watchdog  program  is used to configure the running of system ser-
       vices (daemons).  Watchdog provides a generic way to install/uninstall,
       enable/disable,  start/stop, and run a service, regardless of the oper-
       ating system. When used to run a service, it  starts  the  service  and
       then  watches over it, to restart it should it fail. Watchdog also pro-
       vides general management commands to enable, disable, start,  and  stop
       appweb.

COMMANDS
       disable
              Disable  the service from automatically starting when the system
              is booted.

       enable Enable the service to start automatically on system boot.

       install
              Install the service.

       run    Run the service and monitor its execution. Watchdog  will  auto-
              matically  restart  the  service  should it fail.  Watchdog will
              block unless it is invoked with --daemon.

       start  Start the service.

       stop   Stop the service.

       uninstall
              Uninstall the service.

OPTIONS
       --args arguments
              Arguments to use for the service program command  line  when  it
              starts.

       --console
              Windows  specific option to allow the watchdog process to inter-
              act with the users desktop.

       --daemon
              Run the watchdog as a daemon process. This causes  the  watchdog
              to detach from the current shell and run in the background.

       --heartBeat interval
              Windows  specific option to set the frequency in seconds for the
              watchdog to check on  service.   This  period  should  be  short
              enough  that  the  service  will  be quickly restarted should it
              fail, but not so short that the watchdog process  consumes  sig-
              nificant  CPU resources.  If the service dies more than 30 times
              per hour, the watchdog will suspend restarting the service.

       --home directory
              Set the home directory in which to start the service.

       --log logFile:level
              Specify a file to use  for  log  messages.  The  level  argument
              defines  the  message  verbosity. Zero is the least and 9 is the
              most verbose.

       --retries count
              Number of times to restart the service per hour.

       -v     Output the product version number.
